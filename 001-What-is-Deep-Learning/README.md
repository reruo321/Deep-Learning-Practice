### 1. Artificial Intelligence
**Artificial Intelligence** is the theory + development of computer systems to perform like human intelligence. The early AI was started as symbolic AI, which explicitly define knowledge and rules for the behavior of computer programs.

### 2. Machine Learning
**Machine Learning** gives computers the ability to learn, without being explicitly programmed. To solve more complicated problems like image classification, it became a substitute for symbolic AI.

### 3. Deep Learning
**Deep Learning** is machine learning algorithms with brain-like logical structure of algorithms(= Artificial Neural Networks).

## History of Machine Learning
### Probabilistic Modeling
Some examples are Naive Bayes Algorithm, Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perceptrons.
