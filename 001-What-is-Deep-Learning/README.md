### 1. Artificial Intelligence
**Artificial Intelligence** is the theory + development of computer systems to perform like human intelligence. The early AI was started as symbolic AI, which explicitly define knowledge and rules for the behavior of computer programs.

### 2. Machine Learning
**Machine Learning** gives computers the ability to learn, without being explicitly programmed. To solve more complicated problems like image classification, it became a substitute for symbolic AI.

* Categories:
  1. **Supervised Learning**: Example input + Desired output is given by a human teacher → Learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
  2. **Unsupervised Learning**: No labels are given → Find structure in its input by itself.
  3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Interacts with a dynamic environment (Ex. driving a vehicle or playing a PvP game) → Tries to maximize reward feedback.

### 3. Deep Learning
**Deep Learning** is machine learning algorithms with brain-like logical structure of algorithms(= Artificial Neural Networks).

## History of Machine Learning
### Probabilistic Modeling
Some examples are Naive Bayes Algorithm, Logistic Regression, and Multilayer Perceptrons.
