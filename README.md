# Deep-Learning-Practice
Personal Projects for Deep Learning Practice

The repository will follow the tutorial from a book, "케라스 창시자에게 배우는 딥러닝". ([The tutorial codes for Tensorflow 2](https://github.com/rickiepark/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/tree/tf2))
The programming language is mainly Python, and I'll try some C++ port projects.
