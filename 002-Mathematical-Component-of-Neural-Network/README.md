# Mathematical Component of Neural Network
From this chapter, I will add some sample codes on Google Colab notebooks.

## The First Meeting with Neural Network
### The MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a well-known large database of handwritten digits, and is included in Keras as NumPy format.

### Neural Network
#### Layer
**Layer** is the core of neural network, which is a kind of data processing filter. It exports more meaningful representation from input data.

Most of deep learning models consist of some connected simple layers, and they gradually refines data.
