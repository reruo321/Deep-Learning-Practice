# Mathematical Component of Neural Network
From this chapter, I will add some sample codes on Google Colab notebooks.

## The First Meeting with Neural Network
### The MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a well-known large database of handwritten digits, and is included in Keras as NumPy format.

### Neural Network
#### Layer
**Layer** is the core of neural network, which is a kind of data processing filter. It exports more meaningful representation from input data. Most of deep learning models consist of some connected simple layers, and they gradually refines data.

#### Compiling
To train a neural network, there are three things to be included while compiling it:

  1. **Loss Function**: Measures the performance of neural network with training data, so that it can be trained on the right track.
  2. **Optimizer**: Mechanism to update the network based on input data + loss function.
  3. **Indicator to Monitor Training and Testing**: An example is accuracy, the ratio of correctly classified images.

## Data Expression for Neural Network
### Tensor
**Tensor** is a container
