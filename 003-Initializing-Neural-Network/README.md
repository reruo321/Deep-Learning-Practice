As we saw in the previous units, there are some relevant elements for training a neural network.

* **Layers** that form **network (or model)**
* **Input data** and its **target**
* **Loss function** which defines feedback signal for learning
* **Optimizer** that decides learning method.

### Layer: Component of Deep Learning
